# JavaScript Topics:

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository!

This repository contains a collection of **topics** & **programs** that I have learned and want to keep log of.

I will be adding more as I learn more.

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that runs on the client-side (in web browsers) as well as the server-side (with Node.js). As I delve into JavaScript's rich ecosystem, I've decided to share my learning journey through this repository.

## Installation

1. To explore and run the programs in this repository, you'll need to have (Node.js)[https://nodejs.org/] installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local system using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utsavgwa/js101.git

## Usage

Each program is stored in its own file. To run a specific program, use Node.js on the command line, like this:

```bash
node program_name.js
```

Replace **'program_name.js'** with the name of the program file you want to execute.
